# PythonArchitect
A Python library to generate SVG drawings and code for 3D Visualization in Blender.

This simple library grew out of the need to do some easy sketching of a house. Instead of using complex CAD 
drawing software, I decided to create house plan and 3D visualization through simple python scripts. The idea
is to run a script and generate SVG drawings and blender code in parallel. SVG drawings are used for visualization
of 2D drawings. In order to see the 2D drawings you may use InkScape or any other SVG visualization software. 
Blender code is generated to create 3D visualization within Blender. Just execute the generated Python
code from the Python console of Blender.
